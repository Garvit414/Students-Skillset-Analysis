# Students-Skillset-Analysis

### Project Information:
<b> Target Audience:</b> Undergraduate students enrolled in Bachelors of Technology<br>
<b>Motive:</b> Research on studentsâ€™ technical skillset and factors contributing in their skill development.

### Project Timeline:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Univariate and Bivariate analysis
4. Statistical Analysis
5. Visualization
6. Report Preparation

### Data Collection:
<b>Method of data collection:</b> Survey through Google forms <br>
Reason for selection: Data under analysis belongs to undergraduate students, who are persuing Bachelors in Technology. The four year course produces a major technically sound workforce which boost up the service sector. Being a major contributor to the service sector, the students must have a technically sound skillset which can land them into companies without much struggle.<br>
The skillset required as per the jobs are different as per the role, but few factors contribute to each skillset. These factors and their corelation will be studied in the research. Several hypothesis will be considered from obseravations of the data, which will be tested using statistical tests for rejection/non rejection.
